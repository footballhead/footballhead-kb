Leaderboard: https://www.speedrun.com/d2lod

Current competitive category is Any% Baal Hell PX HC

Strats:

- Poison + Bone
    - Start with Teeth, then Switch to Bone Spear at lvl 18.
    - Clay Golem + Iron Maiden can make quick work of early bosses
    - Corpse Explosion - when/where/why?
    - Bone wall/bone prison: imobilize enemies while you bone spear them. Good for Chaos Sanctuary
- Jail strats (Indrek strats): Rush to Jail 1 (jail 3?), reset map with Other Multiplayer until 
- Classic strats: When you create a character, you can choose whether or not this is an Expansion Character. Expansion characters play the game with the LOD expansion (Act 5, runes and runewords, class-specific items, staves with +1 skill that other characters can use, etc). A non-Expanion Character is called a Classic Character. Classic characters can be upgraaded to expansion once at any point; they cannot be downgraded back to classic. This is allowed since the category only requires you to kill Hell Baal; you could beat the entire game on classic, upgrade to expansion, then beat Hell Baal and it would count.
    - Pros: Can skip Act 5 normal (and technically nightmare)
    - Con: No teleport staff
    - Con: No runewords (no stealth)
    - Con: Loss of Act 5 farming spots like Eldritch.
- Good farming spots:
    - Rakinishu (Act 1 Stony Field)
    - Jail strats (Act 1 Jail 1/3)
    - Beetleburst (Act 2)
    - Pindel (Act 5)
    - Eldritch (Act 5)
- Map strats: want a specific town/blood moor layout
- Gold:
    - early: posion potion, exploding potion, throwing knives, javalins
    - late: studded armor, plate armor, rares, etc
    - always wands, staves, rings, amulets
- other items: runes, chipped gmes
- stats: faster run walk, faster cast rate, +poison bone skills
- reroll items: white/blue + 3 chipped gems; good for staves (money), wands (find +poison/bome)
- teleport staff: level 23
