Genshin Optimizer
=================

Genshin Optimizer requires that you input all your profile data into the tool first. People have automated this process with tools called Scanners. These use an OCR approach to scan video or a set of screenshots to generate a JSON databse suitable for import.

For artifacts, I've had the most success with Artiscan. For characters and weapons, Invetory Kamera seems to work well.

Inventory Kamera
================

Source: https://github.com/Andrewthe13th/Inventory_Kamera

Inventory Kamera is a C# program that will OCR screenshot text (this uses Tesseract) to generate a Genshin Optimizer database. You can control the process manually or have the program control itself by injecting key inputs (this uses WindowInputs).
