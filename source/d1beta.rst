Diablo Beta
===========

While I started my reverse-engineering journey on the Diablo Beta (since it's so close to Devilution), I actually know very little about it...

----------
Installing
----------

#. Install Beta, you can find the ISO at Diablo Evolution: https://diablo-evolution.net/index.php?pageid=files
#. Install blankname's Beta Unlock Patch, you get it from the same place: https://diablo-evolution.net/index.php?pageid=files
#. Download and extract my dungeon unlocker: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11wxrnx9t3IehOtz_RnRa3Kf9Z_iD3tAS/view
#. Copy diablo.exe from blankname's Beta Unlock Patch into the dungeon unlocker folder
#. Run patch.bat. This will pop open a terminal. If there are no errors then close the window. If vcdiff fails to run then please make sure you're running an up-to-date copy of Windows 10 and try again.
#. Copy diablomod.exe into your install directory (default is ``C:\DIABLO``)
#. Run ``diablomod.exe`` and enjoy!

This should work with both normal and nocd versions of blankname's patch.

My patches (Dungeon Unlocker)

Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/moralbacteria/diablo-beta-patches

This has some binary patches as well as instructions to fix other problems.

My DDRAW.DLL Mods
-----------------

GitHub: https://github.com/footballhead/diablo-ddrawwrapper/tree/bnet_beta

.. warning:: This requires blankname's fix. Eventually, I intend to incorporate that fix but haven't gotten there yet. I am missing the necessary mods to ``STORM.DLL``/``diabloui.dll``/``standard.snp``.

This includes:

- Dungeon Unlocker (access levels 6-8)
- Poison Water fix
- Catacomb warp fix
- Fix bone spirit to use Elemental graphics
- Cheats! Pressing Z gives a bunch of gold, all the spells, and a level up

------
Spells
------

Two things happen when you read a book:

#. Increase slvl by 1
#. Set the corresponding entry in the "spell has been learned" bitmap. Counterintuitively, this is a separate field from slvl.

A spell with spell level of 0 is uncastable, along with a spell that hasn't been learned. These are governed by separate memory addresses and structures:

- Starting at ``0x0062D94A``, each spell gets 1 (signed) byte for spell level
- Starting at ``0x0062D990`` is a bit map of which spells have been learned (1 is cast-able, 0 is not)

So to learn Firebolt (spell ID=0), you must:

- Set ``0x0062D94A`` to ``1`` (or higher, but not too high because it's signed)
- Take the value of ``0x0062D990``, bitwise OR the value with ``0x1``, then store it at the same address.

Since there are 36 spells, you'll need to modify 36 bytes starting at ``0x0062D94A``, and set 5 bytes (~36 bits) to ``0xFF``.

.. tip:: They left the MaxSpellsCheat function in so just call that?

Spells That Don't Work
======================

The following spells don't work for one reason or another:

- Mana shield - can still be killed even if you have mana
- Guardian - casting has no effect
- Doom Serpents - no effect
- Blood Ritual - no effect
- Invisibility - no effect
- Golem - the game crashes if part of Nova touches it

  - NOTE TO SELF: This could be the "no two missiles on one space" crash that you fixed in pre-ablo...

- Apocalypse - no effect
- Etherealize - no effect
- Bone Spirit - crashes on cast

  - NOTE TO SELF: This graphic is missing
