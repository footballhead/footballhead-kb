General
-------

A sock is just a tube with a closed end at the toes, a bend at the heel, and ribbing at the cuff.

There two basic ways approaches to socks:

- toe-up: start with a few stitches (tyically 4 on a needle), then increase to the final size. The benefit of this is that you don't need to know you're final stitch count in advance since you can try on the sock.
- cuff-down: need to know how many stitches up front

There are several ways to do the heel, here are some popular options:

- afterthought: very easy, it's the toe in reverse (decrease instead of increase); can be done after the main tube of the sock is complete. Typically, you knit a lifeline out of scrap yarn which is picked up.
- short row: what you see on any store-bought socks
- dutch/square

Socks can be done on double-pointed needles or circular (magic loop) needles.

They can be done one at a time, or two at a time. When done two at a time there are several approaches.
