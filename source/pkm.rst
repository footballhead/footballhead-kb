Personal Knowledge Management

a.k.a. the practice of just writing stuff down!

-------------------------------
Sphinx is my current preference
-------------------------------

I use Sphinx since I was exposed to it at work and reStructuredText has only grown on me since.

--------------------------------
reStructuredText versus Markdown
--------------------------------

Plain-text is a popular data storage format. reStructuredText and Markdown seem to be the most popular, however there are `others <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language>`_. Whether you use rst or md, I think this largely comes down to personal preference.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * -
      - rst
      - md
    * - HTML Rendering?
      - Yes (Sphinx)
      - Yes (jekyll)
    * - Extendable?
      - Yes (Sphinx extensions)
      - Yes (jekyll plugins)
    * - Hosting?
      - Yes (readthedocs.io)
      - Yes (GitHub Pages)
    * - ``[[WikiLinks]]``?
      - No (idea for an extension?)
      - Yes (Foam, Obsidian)
    * - To-Do Lists?
      - No (idea for an extension?)
      - Yes

I find Sphinx easier to setup since I'm a Python guy; If you believe the website, jekyll is just as easy to setup and run.

Alternatives

Things that I've tried and discarded for one reason or another:

- Bullet journal (and other physical notebooks)
- TiddlyWiki
- Zim
- Obsidian
- Foam (* I actually use this at work just not personally)
