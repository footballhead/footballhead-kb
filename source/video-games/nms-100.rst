==================
No Man's Sky v1.00
==================

1.00 is the version shipped on the PS4 disk. Most people probably haven't played it since `the developers urged people to download the day-one patch <http://web.archive.org/web/20160807221156/http://www.no-mans-sky.com/2016/08/update-1-03/>`_. Since 1.00 isn't on Steam, a release-day PS4 disk is the only way to play 1.00.

There are a few videos on YouTube exploring this (now rare) version:

My rough notes
--------------

I don't own a 1.00 disk, these are things I've noted watching the above videos.

-   Resources stack to 100 (both in exosuit and starship)
-   Cannot “Move and Stack” items (no reordering inventory)
-   Item details lack per-item and total worth
-   Exosuit hazard protection can be repaired with Iron
-   Distress Beacon uses different model
-   Atlas Path dialogue is different
-   Use Scanner by pressing Circle button (PS4 controller)
-   Mining Beam overheats as soon as the bar is full
-   Heridium deposits are mound-shaped, gold color
-   Emeril deposits are pillar shaped, blackish color

    -   I learned __ new words

-   Distance is “.” not “units”

    -   Discovery uploaded
    -   __U credited. The galactic library thanks you

-   ??? Different Damaged Machinery sound
-   ??? Damaged Machinery // Get blueprint
-   Upgrade tiers are v1, v2, v3, v4 (not Sigma, Tau, etc)
-   Can talk to the distress beacon more than once (may require exploring and coming back, also might be only before first lift-off?)
-   No save graphic (message is only “restore point saved”)
-   Destroying one wave of sentinels escalates and spawns the next. Only way to de-escalate is to flee

-   On Galaxy map, Atlas Stations have read indicators and black holes have black indicators
-   POI icons are different

-   Sell dialog only shows items you have (no grayed out entries)

-   Options menu has different units icon (underneath name, top-left corner)

Atlas Path Dialogue

Distress Beacon
===============

Initial text:

    I've seen things, a few things, before.

    I left the sun and moon far behind. Galaxies were waiting to be found.

    It begins and ends with you. Infinity awaits.

    -   Resist
    -   Refuse
    -   Begin

Resist:

?

Refuse:

?

Begin:

    It begins.

    I feel as if an unknown power is guiding me. We are combined as one.

(Interact with Waypoint // Beacon, get coords for Outpost)

Acquire Hyperdrive Technology

Follow Signal to Contact Lifeform

    I am greeted by a strange warrior lifeform. It has been tracking my starship's movements through the planet's atmosphere, but gives the impression that it has been waiting for far longer.

    It tilts its head, and curls its lips back over its teeth. I am aboutto speak, when it abruptly raises its arm to silence me. It produces what looks (sic) the schematics of an advanced technology. It barks, and indicates that I should take it.

    -   Take the blueprint

Take the blueprint

    The warrior barks again in satisfaction. Faint red orbs appear briefly in its eyes.

    Its mission appears complete.
