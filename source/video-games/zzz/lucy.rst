.. note:: Need 1923 ATK for full Cheer On! effect

    TODO is this initial ATK?

    ``x * 0.258 + 104 = 600`` where ``x`` is ATK. Solve for ``x``: ``x = 1922.48``

    -   658 at Level 60, Core F
    -   624 from Kaboom the Cannon
    -   316 from slot 2
    -   10% from Hormone Punk/Astral Voice 2PC

    (This assumes M6 with level 16 Special Attack. The lower the Special attack level, the higher the ATK needs to be)
