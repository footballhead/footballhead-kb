    TODO: Is this initial ATK?

    Sources of ATK:

    -   661 at Level 60, Core F
    -   624 from Tremor Trigram Vessel (his signature A-Rank W-Engine)
    -   316 from slot 2
    -   +30% from Slot 4
    -   +30% from Slot 5
    -   +30% from Slot 6
    -   +10% from Hormone Punk 2PC
    -   +10% from Astral Voice
    
    1601 + 110% = 3362.1 ATK. Options:

    -   Slot 4: CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG 
    -   slot 5: Physical DMG%

Core Passive:

-   M6: 720 Sheer Force (at 3000 ATK) to next agent entering via Quick Assist or Chain Attack
-   Quick Assist from EX Special

.. note:: Need 3000 ATK.

    Before M6:

    ``540 Sheer Force = x * 0.18`` where ``x`` is ATK. Implies ``x = 3000``

    M6 also yields ``x = 3000``

Additional Ability (Rupture, Yunkui Summit):

-   M1: +30% DMG from EX Special

Mindscapes:

-   M1: +10% DMG to Additional Ability
-   M6: +720 Sheer force (instead of +540)
