Ice, Defense

Summary:

-   +700 ATK
-   +40% DMG (at 27000 initial Max HP)
-   +5% Max HP (Ether Veil)
-   Consumes fewer Assist Points on Perfect Assist (Defence Agent)
-   Ends current Ether Veil before opening again (synergizes with Ye Shunguang better than Lucia)
-   Source of Quick Assists for Astral Voice

.. note:: Need 27000 initial Max HP for full Additional Ability effect.

    -   9117 at Level 60 with Core F
    -   2200 from Drive Disk Slot 1
    -   +25% from Original Transformpher W-Engine main stat
    -   +30% from slot 4
    -   +30% from slot 5
    -   +30% from slot 6
    -   +10% from Yunkui Tales 2PC

    That's 25463.25 HP. Since an HP% roll is +3% HP (339.51 HP), the remaining 1536.75 can be achieved with around 4.5 HP% substat rolls.

    -   Can replace Yunkui Tales with 2PC Energy Regen if you make up the 3.33 HP% substat rolls
    -   Can replace slot 6 with Energy Regen if you make up the 10 HP% substat rolls. Note that an ER Slot 6 can roll HP% up to 6 times; the other 4 need to be covered by others

    To use ER 2PC and slot 6 and hit 27000 HP, you need ~19 rolls of HP%; this averages to around 5 rolls per piece (since you can't roll HP% on slot 4 or 5). This is incredibly high so good luck!

Core skill:

-   +1.2% CRIT Rate for every 1000 HP (to herself only); this doesn't seem to cap like her DMG% buff. At 27000, this is +32.4% CRIT Rate.
-   Ether Veil gives +5% Max HP to all squad members
-   Activating Ether Veil gives 700 ATK to all squad members for 50s

Core skill Additional Ability (Attack, Anomaly, Support):

-   Ether Veil gives +40% DMG bonus at 27000 Max HP

Sets:

-   4PC Astral Voice: +ATK% from Quick Assist
-   4PC : +ATK% from Defensive Assists
-   2PC : + Energy regen
