Ether, Support (Rupture)

Summary:

-   Aftershock every 8s. Each Aftershock is randomly either a Basic, Special, or Assist skill.
-   +5% Max HP from Ether Veil
-   +20% DMG (skill upgrade or after shock)
-   +30% CRIT DMG
-   +900 Sheer Force (at "initial" 24000 Max HP)

.. note:: Darkbreaker caps out at 24000 initial Max HP.

    HP% from gear:

    -   8477 HP at Level 60
    -   2200 HP from Drive Disk slot 1
    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 4
    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 5
    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 6
    -   +10% from Yunkui Tales 2PC set effect
 
    That's 10677 + 100% = 21354. Since an HP% roll is 320.32 HP, the remaining 2646 HP can be made up with 8.26 HP% substat rolls.

    After that, you can focus on CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG to make her aftershocks hit harder. With Dreamlit Hearth (her signature W-Engine, +30% initial Max HP), consider a CRIT Rate slot 6.

    Since Yunkui Tales 2PC is worth 3.33 HP% substat rolls, you could consider another 2PC set like CRIT Rate (depending on substats).

    Lucia doesn't need energy regen slot 6 or 2PC. It takes 24s to use all her Dream Points with aftershocks; if you use an energy regen F2P weapon or Dreamlit Hearth, you should get enough energy in that time.

Core Skill Core Passive:

-   +5% Max HP from Ether Veil
-   +20% DMG (skill upgrade or after shock)
-   Perfect Assists when entering the the Dream State (bar fills up)

Core Skill Additional Ability (Rupture, Stun):

-   +30% CRIT DMG from Darkbreaker (using Harmony)

Special Attack:

-   +900 Sheer Force (24000 Max HP)

Weapons:

-   Dreamlit Hearth: Signature S-Rank. HP% main stat with other bonuses
-   Kaboom the Canon: Energy Regen main stat, ATK% effect

Playstyle:

-   When not in the dream state, use her EX (+60 Dream Points) followed by Basic Attack (+40 Dream Points) to reach 100 Dream Points and enter Dream state
-   When in dream state, let her do her thing. It doesn't make a lot of sense to sit on her to drain Dream Points faster opportunity cost dictates that you should probably be attacking with another character
-   Use EX Special Attack
