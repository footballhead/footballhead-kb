Ether, Support (Rupture)

Summary:

-   +20% DMG
-   +30% CRIT DMG
-   +900 Sheer Force (at 24000 initial Max HP)
-   +5% Max HP (Ether Veil)
-   +18% DMG (Moonlight Lullaby 4PC)
-   +25% DMG (Dreamlit Hearth S1)
-   +15% Max HP (Dreamlit Hearth S1)
-   Ultimate heals
-   Aftershock every 8s. Each Aftershock is randomly either a Basic, Special, or Assist skill.

.. note:: Need 24000 initial Max HP for full Darkbreaker effect.

    -   8477 at Level 60, Core F
    -   2200 from slot 1
    -   +30% from slot 4
    -   +30% from slot 5
    -   +30% from slot 6
    -   +10% from Yunkui Tales 2PC
 
    That's 10677 + 100% = 21354. Since an HP% roll is 320.32 HP, the remaining 2646 HP can be made up with 8.26 rolls of HP% substat. This is ~3 rolls per Disk Drive (assuming HP% slot 4/5/6).

    After that, you can focus on CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG to make her aftershocks hit harder. Dreamlit Hearth gives +30% Max HP (the same as a Drive Disk) so you can substitute slot 6 for CRIT Rate.

    Since Yunkui Tales 2PC is worth 3.33 HP% substat rolls, you could consider another 2PC set like Shining Aria.

    Lucia doesn't need energy regen slot 6 or 2PC. It takes 24s to use all her Dream Points with aftershocks; if you use an energy regen F2P weapon or Dreamlit Hearth, you should get enough energy in that time.

-   4PC Moonlight Lullaby: +18% DMG for team

Playstyle:

-   When not in the dream state, use her EX (+60 Dream Points) followed by Basic Attack (+40 Dream Points) to reach 100 Dream Points and enter Dream state
-   When in dream state, let her do her thing. It doesn't make a lot of sense to sit on her to drain Dream Points faster opportunity cost dictates that you should probably be attacking with another character
-   Use EX Special Attack
