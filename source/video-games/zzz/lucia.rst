Ether, Support (Rupture)

Summary:

-   +20% DMG
-   +30% CRIT DMG
-   +900 Sheer Force (at 24000 initial Max HP)
-   +5% Max HP (Ether Veil)
-   +18% DMG (Moonlight Lullaby 4PC)
-   +25% DMG (Dreamlit Hearth S1)
-   +15% Max HP (Dreamlit Hearth S1)
-   Ultimate heals
-   Aftershock every 8s. Each Aftershock is randomly either a Basic, Special, or Assist skill.

.. note:: Need 24000 initial Max HP for full Darkbreaker effect. F2P needs 19.06 rolls of HP% to reach that. Only 9.09 with Dreamlit Hearth.

    Without Drive Disk Sub-Stats or W-Engine Advanced Stat (assuming you don't have Dreamlit Hearth):

    -   8477 at Level 60, Core F
    -   2200 from slot 1
    -   2543.1 (30%) from slot 4
    -   2543.1 (30%) from slot 5
    -   2543.1 (30%) from slot 6
    -   847.7 (10%) from Yunkui Tales 2PC
 
    This gives 19154 inital Max HP to start. Looking at potential Drive Disk Sub-Stat rolls

    - 254.31 (3%) for HP%, totalling 4577.58 (assuming 18 rolls: slots 1/2/3, 1 initial roll, 5 rolls from leveling up) Can be found on slots 1/2/3. This gives (1 rolls on disk + 5 rolls from leveling)
    - 112 for HP, totalling 2016 (assuming 18 rolls: slots 4/5/6, 1 initial roll, 5 rolls from leveling.)

    (This means an 1 HP roll is worth 0.44 HP% rolls)

    Without Dreamlit Heart, need 4846 HP (24000-19154) from Sub-Stats. This is 19.06 rolls of HP%; this is technically doable with some contribution from HP rolls.
    
    Dreamlit Hearth (30%) knocks 10 rolls off that for 9.06 rolls of HP%.

    If you manage to hit that, focus on personal damage: CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG.
    
Core Skill Core Passive:

-   +5% Max HP from Ether Veil
-   +20% DMG (skill upgrade or after shock)
-   Perfect Assists when entering the the Dream State (bar fills up)

Core Skill Additional Ability (Rupture, Stun):

-   +30% CRIT DMG from Darkbreaker (using Harmony)

Special Attack:

-   +900 Sheer Force (24000 Max HP)

Weapons:

-   Dreamlit Hearth: Signature S-Rank. +30% initial Max HP. +15% HP, +25% DMG.
-   Kaboom the Canon: Energy Regen main stat, ATK% effect

Disk Drives:

-   4PC Moonlight Lullaby: +18% DMG for team
-   2PC Yunkui Tales: +10% initial Max HP for herself
-   2PC Shining Aria: +10% Ether DMG for herself

Playstyle:

-   When not in the dream state, use her EX (+60 Dream Points) followed by Basic Attack (+40 Dream Points) to reach 100 Dream Points and enter Dream state
-   When in dream state, let her do her thing. It doesn't make a lot of sense to sit on her to drain Dream Points faster opportunity cost dictates that you should probably be attacking with another character
-   Use EX Special Attack
