Electric, Stun

Summary:

-   +80% Stun DMG Multiplier
-   +30% CRIT DMG (King of the Summit 4PC)
-   Requires lots of field time; both to accumulate Daze and to stack subjugation
-   +600 ATK for self (at 220 Impact)
-   +60% DMG to Chain Attack for self

.. note:: Need 220 Impact for full Additional Ability effect

    -   136 at Level 60, Core F
    -   +18% from S-Rank W-Engine main stat
    -   +6% from Shockstar Disco 2PC
    -   +18% from slot 6

    With 136 + 42%, Agent Base Stats page should show ``193``. This is currently Qingyi's max Impact out of combat.

    Choice of W-Engine:

    -   18% + 25% (Blazing Laurel S1): 227 (Requires Quick/Perfect Assist)
    -   18% + 20% (Hellfire Gears S1): 220 (Requires Energy)
    -   18% + 21% (Ice-Jade Teapot S1): 221
    -   0% + 25.6% (Steam Oven): 203 (Requires Energy)
    -   12% + 0% (Vortex Arrow): 184. 96
    -   0 + 13% (Vortex Hatchet): 186.32

    (Can also get +10% Impact from a support agent with Reverb Mark I but this comes at a high opportunity cost).

Core Passive:

-   +80% Stun DMG Multiplier (20 Subjugation, +4% each)
-   10 Subjugation from Perfect Dodge during Enhanced Basic
-   5 Subjugation from Enhanced Basic finisher otherwise

Additional Ability (Attack, N.E.P.S.):

-   20% more daze from basic attacks
-   +600 ATK (for self) at 220 Impact

.. note:: ``600 = max(x - 120, 0) * 6 ==> x = 220``

Basic Attack:

-   B3: Hold or press attack for continuous attack
-   Not interrupted by Dodge
-   Electric Damage accumulates Flash Connect Voltage (B3+, EX special, etc)
-   Stop attacking for B4, which does more damage if attacking "for a certain time"???
-   +25% DMG (for self) at 100 Flash Connect Voltage
-   +12.5% Daze (for self) at 100 Flash Connect Voltage
-   Releasing Enchanced Basic Attack can trigger Perfect Dodge (builds Core Passive Stun DMG Multipler faster)

Special:

-   Hold EX to consume more energy and perform more attacks
-   EX shortcuts to B3

Ultimate:

-   Chain attack deals +3% DMG for each subjugation (+60% DMG at 20 subjugation)
