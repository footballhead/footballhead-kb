Drive Disks
===========

The maximum number of rolls an artifact can have is 9

-   S rank artifacts start with either 3 or 4 rolls.
-   Since a new stat rools at levels 3/6/9/12/15, that means you get 5 rolls.

Some stats are better than others. One rule of thumb to simplify analysis is to subdivide rolls into:

-   Full stat rolls. These have value of 1. These are stats that you really really really want.
-   Half stat rolls. These have value of 0.5. These still contribute just not as much as full rolls.
-   Useless stats. These have a value of 0. They are worthless and so are omitted entirely.

Rollable substats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 3%
-   DEF%
-   Flat ATK
-   Flat HP: 112
-   Flat DEF
-   CRIT Rate: 2.4%
-   CRIT DMG: 4.8%
-   AP
-   PEN

Slot 4 Main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG
-   AP

Slot 5 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   DMG% (Physical/Electric/Fire/Ice/Ether)
-   PEN%

Slot 6 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   AM
-   Impact
-   Energy regen

.. note::

    For slot 4/5/6, you can't roll the main stat as a substat. E.g. a CRIT DMG slot 4 can't also roll CRIT DMG.

Differences from Genshin
------------------------

- 6 drive disks (compared to 5 artifacts)
- You tend to run one 4PC and a different 2PC (compared to a 4PC and an "off piece")
- Energy regen is not a rollable substat
- Stats for ZZZ mechanics: Impact, AP, AM, PEN, PEN% (No Genshin-specific stats: Elemental Mastery)
- Each substat roll has full value (compared to 0.7/0.8/0.9/1.0 random substat rolls)

Attack Theoretical Best
-----------------------

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 3 full rolls: ATK%, CRIT Rate, Crit damage; the 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8.5 (8 full rolls, 1 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, PEN

-   Slot 4: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: CD with ATK%+3, CRIT Rate+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 5: 8.5

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, flat ATK

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: ATK% with CRIT Rate+3, CRIT DMG+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 50

Anomaly Theoretical Best
------------------------

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   Anomaly Proficiency (AP)

.. note::

    Miyabi also benefits from CRIT Rate and crit damage

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 2 full rolls: ATK%, AP; the 3rd and 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 4: 7 (6 full rolls, 2 half rolls, 1 dead stat)

    -   Example: AP with ATK%+5, flat ATK, PEN, DEF%

        .. note::

            As you can imagine, this is very hard to get! The fact that Miyabi can use CRIT Rate and crit damage really helps her in this department

-   Slot 5: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: AM with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 47

Rupture
-------

See Attack but replace ATK% with HP%

Since Attack is converted to Sheer Force, maybe ATK% is a half stat?
