Drive Disks
===========

The maximum number of rolls an artifact can have is 9

-   S rank artifacts start with either 3 or 4 rolls.
-   Since a new stat rolls at levels 3/6/9/12/15, that means you get 5 rolls.

Some stats are better than others. One rule of thumb to simplify analysis is to subdivide rolls into:

-   Full stat rolls. These have value of 1. These are stats that you really really really want.
-   Half stat rolls. These have value of 0.5. These still contribute just not as much as full rolls.
-   Useless stats. These have a value of 0. They are worthless and so are omitted entirely.

Rollable substats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 3%
-   DEF%
-   Flat ATK
-   Flat HP: 112
-   Flat DEF
-   CRIT Rate: 2.4%
-   CRIT DMG: 4.8%
-   AP
-   PEN

Slot 4 Main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG
-   AP

Slot 5 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   DMG% (Physical/Electric/Fire/Ice/Ether)
-   PEN%

Slot 6 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   AM
-   Impact
-   Energy regen

.. note::

    For slot 4/5/6, you can't roll the main stat as a substat. E.g. a CRIT DMG slot 4 can't also roll CRIT DMG.

Differences from Genshin
------------------------

- 6 drive disks (compared to 5 artifacts)
- You tend to run one 4PC and a different 2PC (compared to a 4PC and an "off piece")
- Energy regen is not a rollable substat
- Stats for ZZZ mechanics: Impact, AP, AM, PEN, PEN% (No Genshin-specific stats: Elemental Mastery)
- Each substat roll has full value (compared to 0.7/0.8/0.9/1.0 random substat rolls)

Attack Theoretical Best
-----------------------

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 3 full rolls: ATK%, CRIT Rate, Crit damage; the 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8.5 (8 full rolls, 1 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, PEN

-   Slot 4: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: CD with ATK%+3, CRIT Rate+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 5: 8.5

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, flat ATK

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: ATK% with CRIT Rate+3, CRIT DMG+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 50

Anomaly Theoretical Best
------------------------

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   Anomaly Proficiency (AP)

.. note::

    Miyabi also benefits from CRIT Rate and crit damage

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 2 full rolls: ATK%, AP; the 3rd and 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 4: 7 (6 full rolls, 2 half rolls, 1 dead stat)

    -   Example: AP with ATK%+5, flat ATK, PEN, DEF%

        .. note::

            As you can imagine, this is very hard to get! The fact that Miyabi can use CRIT Rate and crit damage really helps her in this department

-   Slot 5: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: AM with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 47

Rupture
-------

See Attack but replace ATK% with HP%

Since Attack is converted to Sheer Force, maybe ATK% is a half stat?

Support
-------

Supports can be kind of flexible, depending on what they can do and who else is in the team:

-   4PC Astral Voice: +24% DMG for 15s (requires Quick Assists)

    Since this requires frequent Quick Assists, not all characters max out the effect. This is only +8/16% DMG at 1/2 stacks

    The 2PC effect is +10% ATK, which helps agents like Astra hit her breakpoints

-   4PC Moonlit Lullaby: +18% DMG for 25s (requires EX Special Attack or Ultimate)

    This is a much easier condition to satisfy but the payoff is lower. The 2PC effect is Energy Regen as well, which doesn't help all agents equally as much.

-   4PC Swing Jazz: +15% DMG for 12s (requires Chain Attack or Ultimate)

    Compared to Astral Voice: less DMG% at 3 stacks, about equal at 2 stacks, better at 1 stack. Similar(ish) uptimes. However, needs time to come online (need enough Decibels for Ultimate, enough Impact to Stun enemies)

    Compared to Moonlit Lullaby: less DMG%, shorter duration, more restrictive

    Compared to Proto Punk: 2PC ER is better for agents using the set.

-   4PC Proto Punk: +15% DMG for 10s (requires Defensive or Evasive Assist)

    Can be better than Astral voice if you don't get enough Quick Assists or if someone else is already using Astral Voice.

    Can be better than Moonlit Lullaby if someone is already using it.

    Requires Assist Points to maintain. Depending on the boss and team composition, you may only get 3 per stun

    2PC gives +15% shield effect, which is worthless outside a few characters.

-   4PC Freedom Blues: -20% Anomaly Buildup RES for 8s (based on equipper's attribute, requires EX Special)

    Niche Anomaly set.
