Ye Shunguang
============

Honed Edge (Physical), Attack

Summary:

-   High base CRIT Rate
-   +30% CRIT Rate when on battlefield
-   +25% DMG when on battlefield
-   Applies Stun DMG Multipler outside of stun when transformed
-   Get 3 swords when Ether Veil is opened
-   Special Attack can trigger Perfect Dodge (While this does less damage than Dodge Counter (though more Daze), means you don't have to prioritize leveling Dodge Counter)

.. warning:: Ye Shunguang starts at 69.4 CRIT Rate. Aim for 50% on the Agent Base Stats screen.

    -   5% CRIT Rate base (All agents have this)
    -   +14.4% from Core Skill A/C/E 
    -   +30% from Core Skill Passive Effect at F
    -   +20% from 4PC White Water Ballad Drive Disk set effect

    This means you only need 13 CRIT Rate substats to reach 100% CRIT Rate! (Average of around 2 substats per drive disk)

    (Since Core Skill Passive Effect and White Water Ballad are not shown on the Base Stats screen, imagine that 50% is actually 100%. Therefore, don't got over 50%!)

    Since CRIT Rate over 100% is wasted, this makes weapons like Steel Cushion (+24% CRIT Rate) are perhaps a poor choice. It's doable but makes Drive Disk selection trickier since you have fewer relevant substats.

Core Skill Core Passive:

-   +14.4% CRIT Rate
-   +30% CRIT Rate when on battlefield
-   +25% DMG when on battlefield
-   Applies Stun DMG Multipler outside of stun (capped at 110%) for 16s after transforming (using ultimate or 6 swords)

Core skill Additional Ability (Support, Defence)

-   Get 3 swords when Ether Veil is opened by any squadmate (e.g. Lucia, Zhao, Yidhari)

Synergy:

-   Zhao: gets 3 swords whenever they open veil
-   Lucia: gets 3 swords the first time they open veil (since subsequent veils extends duration)

Drive Disks:

-   4PC White Water Ballad: +10% Physical DMG, +20% CRIT Rate, +10% ATK
-   2PC Brand & Blade Song: +16% CRIT DMG
