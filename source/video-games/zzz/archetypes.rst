Archetypes
==========

There's three main archetypes as of 2.5:

#.  Attack
#.  Anomaly/Disorder
#.  Rupture

Attack
------

The most straightfoward: mash the button until they die.

Sub archetypes:

#.  Double support (e.g. Soldier-0 Anby with Nicole and Astra)
#.  Stun + Support (e.g. Evelyn with Lighter and Astra)
#.  (Rare) Double stun (e.g. Hugo with Lycaon and Ligher)

Things to look for in teammates:

-   Stat buffs: ATK%, DMG%, PEN%, CRIT Rate, CRIT damage
-   DEF and DMG% shred (e.g. Nicole)
-   Stun multiplier increase, stun duration increase

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: ATK% + CRIT Rate + CRIT DMG
-   Slot 4: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG (whatever you need more of; there's no point in exceeding 100% CRIT Rate)
-   Slot 5: ATK% or DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: ATK%

Anomaly
-------

Focuses on applying anomalies and disorders. Anomaly and disorder damage scale off ATK and Anomaly Proficiency (AP). Anomaly Mastery (AM) contributes to buildup rate (how fast the bars fill).

Sub archetypes:

#.  2 anomaly of different elements, 1 support (e.g. Miyabi (Frost), Vivian (Ether), Yuzuha (Support))
#.  Alice - Polarity disorder means that she doesn't need another anomaly character so her teams are more flexible
#.  Yanagi Mono-Electro - was only viable for a short while after she released

Things to look for in teammates:

-   Stat buffs: ATK%, DMG%, PEN%, AP, AM
-   DEF and DMG% shred (e.g. Nicole)
-   Anomaly Buildup rate increase

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: ATK%, AP, (ATK and PEN to a lesser extent)
-   Slot 4: AP
-   Slot 5: ATK% ot DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: AM

.. note::

    AM is hard to get since it's not a rollable substat. The only sources of Anomaly Mastery are Slot 6, Phaethon's Melody 2PC, S-rank weapons, and agent inherent stats.

Rupture
-------

Rupture is basically Attack except damage tends to scale on HP%. The main advantage Rupture has over Attack is that it ignores enemy DEF. This is useful against enemies with artificially high DEF or anomaly resistance, and enemies with Miasmic Shields

It uses a special stat called Sheer Force; the more the better (within diminishing returns yada yada yada). You can't roll this on a substat but Agents can provide a boost (e.g. Lucia).

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: HP% + CRIT Rate + CRIT DMG
-   Slot 4: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG (whatever you need more of; there's no point in exceeding 100% CRIT Rate)
-   Slot 5: HP% or DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: HP%
