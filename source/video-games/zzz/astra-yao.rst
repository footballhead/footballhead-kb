    -   715 at level 60 with Core F
    -   624 from Kaboom the Cannon
    -   316 from Drive Disk slot 2
    -   +10% ATK from Astral Voice 2PC
    -   +10% ATK from Hormone Punk 2PC
    -   +30% Attack from Drive Disk slot 4

    1655 + 110% = 3475.5 ATK.

    This is a good starting point. Then you can prioritize Energy Regen with one of:

    -   Anomaly Proficiency: more potent Ether anomalies
    -   CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG: higher damage numbers

Ultimate Tech: get two chains on the same character (e.g. Evelyn)

-   After using Ultimate, but before using Quick Assist: hold Basic Attack to exit Idyllic Cadenza. This allows you to swap back to Astra.
-   The Ultimate triggers a Quick Assist; Quick Assist to the next character to use the first chain attack
-   Swap back to Astra and use Special Attack to enter Idyllic Cadenza. (If you time exiting Idyllic Cadenza with Quick Assist then you might not need to use the Special Attack)
-   The Special Attack triggers a Quick Assst; Quick Assist to the next character to use the second chain attack

W-Engines:

-   Kaboom the Cannon: Energy Regen main stack means more Quick Assists. 

Synergy

-   Everyone wants ATK, but Attack and Anomaly characters make the most use of it
-   CRIT DMG benefits Attack/Rupture agents more than anomaly
-   Vivian: more stacks via Quick Assists
