Fire, Stun

Summary:

-   15% Ice/Fire RES Shred for 30s
-   +3s to Stun duration
-   +75% Ice/Fire DMG
-   

Core Passive:

-   15% Ice/Fire RES Shred for 30s
-   +3s to Stun duration

Additional Ability (Attack, Sons of Calydon)

-   +25% Ice/Fire DMG 
-   +50% Ice/Fire DMG (270 impact)

.. note:: Need 270 Impact to maximize Additional Ability

    There are few sources of Impact (since it's not a Drive Disk substat). Out of combat:

    -   Lighter Level 60, Core F: 137 Impact
    -   W-Engine main stat: +18% with S-Rank
    -   Drive Disk 2PC Set effects: +6% with Shockstar Disco
    -   Impact Drive Disk Slot 6: +18%

    With 137 + 42%, Agent Base Stats page should show ``194`` (``floor(137 * (1 + 0.18 + 0.18 + 0.06)) = floor(194.54) = 194``). This is currently his max Impact out of combat.

    In combat:

    -   Core F Passive morale consumption: +20%
    -   W-Engine effect: +25% from Blazing Laurel (S1)

    137 + 97% = 269 (``floor(137 * (1 + 0.18 + 0.18 + 0.06 + 0.2 + 0.25)) = floor(269.89) = 269``)

    Other options:

    -   Hellfire Gears: Gives +40% at S5 (at the cost of the other Blazing Laurel's other effectss)
    -   Qinyi's Weapon

.. note:: "Every 10 Impact over 170 increases Elation stack effect by 0.25%" can be modeled as:

    ``+75% Fire/Ice DMG = 20 Elation stacks * (1.25% base + 0.25% * max(floor((x - 170) / 10), 0)) Fire/Ice DMG per stack`` where ``x`` is Impact.

    Solve for ``x``.

Synergies:

-   Any Fire or Ice character: Evelyn, Manato, Miyabi, Solider 11, Ellen, Hugo, ...

    Some characters don't activate his Additional Ability: Miyabi (Anomaly), Yidhari (Rupture), Manato (Rupture), Banyue (Rupture), etc.. The easiest way to fix this is to run Lucy; Orphie & Magus is another option. This comes at the opportunity cost of running another S-Rank Support Agent: Miyabi likes Yuzuha, while the Rupture Agents like Lucia.

    Push comes to shove, Lighter without his Additional Ability might still be a better choice than another S-Rank agent (provided that you work around enemy Stun). I suggest to "fuck around and find out".
