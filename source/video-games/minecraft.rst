"Complete the game and reach the credits" (a.k.a kill the Ender Dragon)

Submission: https://www.speedrun.com/mc/runs/y8ko8qny

What's the fastest way to kill the Dragon?
==========================================

#. Wait until it lands on the exit portal
#. Place and use beds (https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Defeating_the_ender_dragon#Beds)

How do I find the Dragon?
=========================

Working backwards

- The Dragon is in the End.
- You get to the End through a Portal in a Stronghold.
- The Portal requires many Eye of Ender to activate
- Eye of Enders are crafted from Ender Pearls and Blaze powder
- Ender Pearls in the speedrun are obtained through bartering with piglin in the nether
- Blaze powder is crafted from blaze rods. blaze rods are dropped by blazes. blazes spawn in nether fortress
- Piglins and Blazes are found in the Nether. You need a Nether portal to get there
- The Nether portal is crafted from Obsidian. It requires a fire (flint and steel or fire charge) to activate

The route taken:

#. Get resources from buried treasure. Craft Flint and Steel, Shovel, Pickaxe, Axe, Bucket, etc.
#. Find lava and use it to form a nether portal
#. Find a bastion and mine gold blocks. Use the gold to trade with piglins for ender pearls
#. Find a nether fortress. kill the blazes for blaze rods.
#. Craft an Eye of Ender to find a Stronghold
#. Go to the stronghold and activate the portal
#. Kill the dragon with Beds
