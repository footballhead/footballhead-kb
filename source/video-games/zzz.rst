ZZZ

Yes, I play ZZZ. No, I will not be taking further questions.

`Zenless Optimizer <https://frzyc.github.io/zenless-optimizer/>`_ is still very much in development as is not as easy to use as Genshin Optimizer.

----------
Archetypes
----------

There's three main archetypes as of 2.5:

#.  Attack
#.  Anomaly/Disorder
#.  Rupture

Attack
======

The most straightfoward: mash the button until they die.

Sub archetypes:

#.  Double support (e.g. Soldier-0 Anby with Nicole and Astra)
#.  Stun + Support (e.g. Evelyn with Lighter and Astra)
#.  (Rare) Double stun (e.g. Hugo with Lycaon and Ligher)

Things to look for in teammates:

-   Stat buffs: ATK%, DMG%, PEN%, CRIT Rate, CRIT damage
-   DEF and DMG% shred (e.g. Nicole)
-   Stun multiplier increase, stun duration increase

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: ATK% + CRIT Rate + CRIT DMG
-   Slot 4: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG (whatever you need more of; there's no point in exceeding 100% CRIT Rate)
-   Slot 5: ATK% or DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: ATK%

Anomaly
=======

Focuses on applying anomalies and disorders. Anomaly and disorder damage scale off ATK and Anomaly Proficiency (AP). Anomaly Mastery (AM) contributes to buildup rate (how fast the bars fill).

Sub archetypes:

#.  2 anomaly of different elements, 1 support (e.g. Miyabi (Frost), Vivian (Ether), Yuzuha (Support))
#.  Alice - Polarity disorder means that she doesn't need another anomaly character so her teams are more flexible
#.  Yanagi Mono-Electro - was only viable for a short while after she released

Things to look for in teammates:

-   Stat buffs: ATK%, DMG%, PEN%, AP, AM
-   DEF and DMG% shred (e.g. Nicole)
-   Anomaly Buildup rate increase

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: ATK%, AP, (ATK and PEN to a lesser extent)
-   Slot 4: AP
-   Slot 5: ATK% ot DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: AM

.. note::

    AM is hard to get since it's not a rollable substat. The only sources of Anomaly Mastery are Slot 6, Phaethon's Melody 2PC, S-rank weapons, and agent inherent stats.

Rupture
=======

Rupture is basically Attack except damage tends to scale on HP%. The main advantage Rupture has over Attack is that it ignores enemy DEF. This is useful against enemies with artificially high DEF or anomaly resistance, and enemies with Miasmic Shields

It uses a special stat called Sheer Force; the more the better (within diminishing returns yada yada yada). You can't roll this on a substat but Agents can provide a boost (e.g. Lucia).

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: HP% + CRIT Rate + CRIT DMG
-   Slot 4: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG (whatever you need more of; there's no point in exceeding 100% CRIT Rate)
-   Slot 5: HP% or DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: HP%

-----------
Drive Disks
-----------

The maximum number of rolls an artifact can have is 9

-   S rank artifacts start with either 3 or 4 rolls.
-   Since a new stat rools at levels 3/6/9/12/15, that means you get 5 rolls.

Some stats are better than others. One rule of thumb to simplify analysis is to subdivide rolls into:

-   Full stat rolls. These have value of 1. These are stats that you really really really want.
-   Half stat rolls. These have value of 0.5. These still contribute just not as much as full rolls.
-   Useless stats. These have a value of 0. They are worthless and so are omitted entirely.

Rollable substats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 3%
-   DEF%
-   Flat ATK
-   Flat HP: 112
-   Flat DEF
-   CRIT Rate: 2.4%
-   CRIT DMG: 4.8%
-   AP
-   PEN

Slot 4 Main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG
-   AP

Slot 5 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   DMG% (Physical/Electric/Fire/Ice/Ether)
-   PEN%

Slot 6 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   AM
-   Impact
-   Energy regen

.. note::

    For slot 4/5/6, you can't roll the main stat as a substat. E.g. a CRIT DMG slot 4 can't also roll CRIT DMG.

Differences from Genshin
========================

- 6 drive disks (compared to 5 artifacts)
- You tend to run one 4PC and a different 2PC (compared to a 4PC and an "off piece")
- Energy regen is not a rollable substat
- Stats for ZZZ mechanics: Impact, AP, AM, PEN, PEN% (No Genshin-specific stats: Elemental Mastery)
- Each substat roll has full value (compared to 0.7/0.8/0.9/1.0 random substat rolls)

Attack Theoretical Best
=======================

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 3 full rolls: ATK%, CRIT Rate, Crit damage; the 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8.5 (8 full rolls, 1 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, PEN

-   Slot 4: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: CD with ATK%+3, CRIT Rate+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 5: 8.5

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, flat ATK

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: ATK% with CRIT Rate+3, CRIT DMG+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 50

Anomaly Theoretical Best
========================

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   Anomaly Proficiency (AP)

.. note::

    Miyabi also benefits from CRIT Rate and crit damage

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 2 full rolls: ATK%, AP; the 3rd and 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 4: 7 (6 full rolls, 2 half rolls, 1 dead stat)

    -   Example: AP with ATK%+5, flat ATK, PEN, DEF%

        .. note::

            As you can imagine, this is very hard to get! The fact that Miyabi can use CRIT Rate and crit damage really helps her in this department

-   Slot 5: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: AM with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 47

Rupture
=======

See Attack but replace ATK% with HP%

Agents
------

Zhao (2.5) - Ice, Defence
=========================

Summary:

-   +5% Max HP to squad (in Ether Veil)
-   +700 ATK to squad (opening Ether Veil)
-   +40% DMG to squad (at 27000 Max HP, in Ether Veil)
-   Consumes fewer assist points on perfect assist (Defence Agent)
-   Ends current Ether Veil before opening again (synergizes with Ye Shunguang better than Lucia)
-   Source of Quick Assists for Astral Voice

.. note:: Zhao's Core Skill Additional Ability caps at 27000 Max HP. Aim for 23300 on the Agent Base Stats screen.

    Zhao has 9117 HP at Level 60. She gets 2200 from Drive Disk Slot 1. Either Veil gives +5%. Core Skill A/C/E gives +18% total.

    Max HP% from gear:

    -   +25% from Original Transformpher W-Engine main stat
    -   +12.5 from Original Transformpher W-Engine effect
    -   +30% from level 15 S-rank Drive Disk slot 4
    -   +30% from level 15 S-rank Drive Disk slot 5

    11317 + 120.5% is 24953.985 HP. To reach 27000, just need ~6 rolls of HP% substats.

    Since the W-Engine effect and Ether Veil are not shown on the Agent Base Stats screen, shoot for 23300.

    Use Energy Regen slot 6, Also, prefer a 2PC that gives energy regen since it can't be rolled; you might be tempted to use Yunkui Tale 2PC (+10% HP) but that can be made up with 3.33 rolls of +HP%. Since each EX Special Attack gives 20 Frostbite points, this means you do more damage, open Ether Veil more often (and give Ye Shunguang more swords)

Core skill:

-   +1.2% CRIT Rate for every 1000 HP (to herself only); this doesn't seem to cap like her DMG% buff. At 27000, this is +32.4% CRIT Rate.
-   Ether Veil gives +5% Max HP to all squad members
-   Activating Ether Veil gives 700 ATK to all squad members for 50s

Core skill Additional Ability (Attack, Anomaly, Support):

-   Ether Veil gives +40% DMG bonus at 27000 Max HP

Synergies:

-   Ye Shunguang: gets 3 Qingming Sword Force when the veil is opneed

Sets:

-   4PC Astral Voice: +ATK% from Quick Assist
-   4PC : +ATK% from Defensive Assists
-   2PC : + Energy regen


Ye Shunguang (2.5) - Honed Edge (Physical), Attack
==================================================

Summary:

-   High base CRIT Rate
-   +30% CRIT Rate when on battlefield
-   +25% DMG when on battlefield
-   Applies Stun DMG Multipler outside of stun when transformed
-   Get 3 swords when Ether Veil is opened
-   Special Attack can trigger Perfect Dodge (While this does less damage than Dodge Counter (though more Daze), means you don't have to prioritize leveling Dodge Counter)

.. warning:: Ye Shunguang starts at 69.4 CRIT Rate. Aim for 50% on the Agent Base Stats screen.

    -   5% CRIT Rate base (All agents have this)
    -   +14.4% from Core Skill A/C/E 
    -   +30% from Core Skill Passive Effect at F
    -   +20% from 4PC White Water Ballad Drive Disk set effect

    This means you only need 13 CRIT Rate substats to reach 100% CRIT Rate! (Average of around 2 substats per drive disk)

    (Since Core Skill Passive Effect and White Water Ballad are not shown on the Base Stats screen, imagine that 50% is actually 100%. Therefore, don't got over 50%!)

    Since CRIT Rate over 100% is wasted, this makes weapons like Steel Cushion (+24% CRIT Rate) are perhaps a poor choice. It's doable but makes Drive Disk selection trickier since you have fewer relevant substats.

Core Skill Core Passive:

-   +14.4% CRIT Rate
-   +30% CRIT Rate when on battlefield
-   +25% DMG when on battlefield
-   Applies Stun DMG Multipler outside of stun (capped at 110%) for 16s after transforming (using ultimate or 6 swords)

Core skill Additional Ability (Support, Defence)

-   Get 3 swords when Ether Veil is opened by any squadmate (e.g. Lucia, Zhao, Yidhari)

Synergy:

-   Zhao: gets 3 swords whenever they open veil
-   Lucia: gets 3 swords the first time they open veil (since subsequent veils extends duration)

Drive Disks:

-   4PC White Water Ballad: +10% Physical DMG, +20% CRIT Rate, +10% ATK
-   2PC Brand & Blade Song: +16% CRIT DMG

Lucia - Ether, Support
======================

Summary:

-   Aftershock every 8s
-   +5% Max HP from Ether Veil
-   +20% DMG (skill upgrade or after shock)
-   +30% CRIT DMG
-   +900 Sheer Force (at 24000 Max HP)

.. note:: Darkbreaker caps out at 24000 Max HP. Aim for 22400 HP (without Dreamlit Hearth) or 20800 HP (with Dreamlit Hearth) on the Agent Base Stats screen.

    Level 60 Lucia has 8477 HP. Drive Disk slot 1 gives 2200 HP. Ether Veil gives +5%.

    HP% from gear:

    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 4
    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 5
    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 6
    -   +10% from Yunkui Tales 2PC set effect
 
    10677 + 105% HP is 21887.85. The remaining 2112.15 HP can be made up with 7 HP% substat rolls.

    After that, you can focus on CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG to make her aftershocks hit harder. With Dreamlit Hearth (her signature W-Engine which gives +45% HP at P1), consider a CRIT Rate slot 6.

    You Base Stats should read roughly 22400 HP (since the +15% from Ether Veil and Yuikui Tales 2PC only show in combat). With Dreamlit Hearth (another +15% only shown in combat), aim for 20800 HP.

    Since Yunkui Tales 2PC with worth 3.33 HP% substat rolls, you could consider another 2PC set like CRIT Rate.

Core Skill Core Passive:

-   +5% Max HP from Ether Veil
-   +20% DMG (skill upgrade or after shock)
-   Perfect Assists when entering the the Dream State (bar fills up)

Core Skill Additional Ability (Rupture, Stun):

-   +30% CRIT DMG from Darkbreaker (using Harmony)

Special Attack:

-   +900 Sheer Force (24000 Max HP)

Playstyle:

-   When not in the dream state, use her EX (+60 Dream Points) followed by Basic Attack (+40 Dream Points) to reach 100 Dream Points and enter Dream state
-   When in dream state, let her do her thing. It doesn't make a lot of sense to sit on her to drain Dream Points faster opportunity cost dictates that you should probably be attacking with another character
-   Use EX Special Attack
