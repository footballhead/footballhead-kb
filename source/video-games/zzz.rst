ZZZ

Yes, I play ZZZ. No, I will not be taking further questions.

`Zenless Optimizer <https://frzyc.github.io/zenless-optimizer/>`_ is still very much in development as is not as easy to use as Genshin Optimizer.

----------
Archetypes
----------

There's three main archetypes as of 2.5:

#.  Attack
#.  Anomaly/Disorder
#.  Rupture

Attack
======

The most straightfoward: mash the button until they die.

Sub archetypes:

#.  Double support (e.g. Soldier-0 Anby with Nicole and Astra)
#.  Stun + Support (e.g. Evelyn with Lighter and Astra)
#.  (Rare) Double stun (e.g. Hugo with Lycaon and Ligher)

Things to look for in teammates:

-   Stat buffs: ATK%, DMG%, PEN%, CRIT Rate, CRIT damage
-   DEF and DMG% shred (e.g. Nicole)
-   Stun multiplier increase, stun duration increase

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: ATK% + CRIT Rate + CRIT DMG
-   Slot 4: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG (whatever you need more of; there's no point in exceeding 100% CRIT Rate)
-   Slot 5: ATK% or DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: ATK%

Anomaly
=======

Focuses on applying anomalies and disorders. Anomaly and disorder damage scale off ATK and Anomaly Proficiency (AP). Anomaly Mastery (AM) contributes to buildup rate (how fast the bars fill).

Sub archetypes:

#.  2 anomaly of different elements, 1 support (e.g. Miyabi (Frost), Vivian (Ether), Yuzuha (Support))
#.  Alice - Polarity disorder means that she doesn't need another anomaly character so her teams are more flexible
#.  Yanagi Mono-Electro - was only viable for a short while after she released

Things to look for in teammates:

-   Stat buffs: ATK%, DMG%, PEN%, AP, AM
-   DEF and DMG% shred (e.g. Nicole)
-   Anomaly Buildup rate increase

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: ATK%, AP, (ATK and PEN to a lesser extent)
-   Slot 4: AP
-   Slot 5: ATK% ot DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: AM

.. note::

    AM is hard to get since it's not a rollable substat. The only sources of Anomaly Mastery are Slot 6, Phaethon's Melody 2PC, S-rank weapons, and agent inherent stats.

Rupture
=======

Rupture is basically Attack except damage tends to scale on HP%. The main advantage Rupture has over Attack is that it ignores enemy DEF. This is useful against enemies with artificially high DEF or anomaly resistance, and enemies with Miasmic Shields

It uses a special stat called Sheer Force; the more the better (within diminishing returns yada yada yada). You can't roll this on a substat but Agents can provide a boost (e.g. Lucia).

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: HP% + CRIT Rate + CRIT DMG
-   Slot 4: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG (whatever you need more of; there's no point in exceeding 100% CRIT Rate)
-   Slot 5: HP% or DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: HP%

-----------
Drive Disks
-----------

The maximum number of rolls an artifact can have is 9

-   S rank artifacts start with either 3 or 4 rolls.
-   Since a new stat rools at levels 3/6/9/12/15, that means you get 5 rolls.

Some stats are better than others. One rule of thumb to simplify analysis is to subdivide rolls into:

-   Full stat rolls. These have value of 1. These are stats that you really really really want.
-   Half stat rolls. These have value of 0.5. These still contribute just not as much as full rolls.
-   Useless stats. These have a value of 0. They are worthless and so are omitted entirely.

Rollable substats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 3%
-   DEF%
-   Flat ATK
-   Flat HP: 112
-   Flat DEF
-   CRIT Rate: 2.4%
-   CRIT DMG: 4.8%
-   AP
-   PEN

Slot 4 Main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG
-   AP

Slot 5 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   DMG% (Physical/Electric/Fire/Ice/Ether)
-   PEN%

Slot 6 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%: 30%
-   DEF%
-   AM
-   Impact
-   Energy regen

.. note::

    For slot 4/5/6, you can't roll the main stat as a substat. E.g. a CRIT DMG slot 4 can't also roll CRIT DMG.

Differences from Genshin
========================

- 6 drive disks (compared to 5 artifacts)
- You tend to run one 4PC and a different 2PC (compared to a 4PC and an "off piece")
- Energy regen is not a rollable substat
- Stats for ZZZ mechanics: Impact, AP, AM, PEN, PEN% (No Genshin-specific stats: Elemental Mastery)
- Each substat roll has full value (compared to 0.7/0.8/0.9/1.0 random substat rolls)

Attack Theoretical Best
=======================

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 3 full rolls: ATK%, CRIT Rate, Crit damage; the 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8.5 (8 full rolls, 1 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, PEN

-   Slot 4: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: CD with ATK%+3, CRIT Rate+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 5: 8.5

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, flat ATK

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: ATK% with CRIT Rate+3, CRIT DMG+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 50

Anomaly Theoretical Best
========================

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   Anomaly Proficiency (AP)

.. note::

    Miyabi also benefits from CRIT Rate and crit damage

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 2 full rolls: ATK%, AP; the 3rd and 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 4: 7 (6 full rolls, 2 half rolls, 1 dead stat)

    -   Example: AP with ATK%+5, flat ATK, PEN, DEF%

        .. note::

            As you can imagine, this is very hard to get! The fact that Miyabi can use CRIT Rate and crit damage really helps her in this department

-   Slot 5: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: AM with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 47

Rupture
=======

See Attack but replace ATK% with HP%

------
Agents
------

Zhao (2.5) - Ice, Defence
=========================

Summary:

-   +5% Max HP to squad (in Ether Veil)
-   +700 ATK to squad (opening Ether Veil)
-   +40% DMG to squad (at "initial" 27000 Max HP, in Ether Veil)
-   Consumes fewer assist points on perfect assist (Defence Agent)
-   Ends current Ether Veil before opening again (synergizes with Ye Shunguang better than Lucia)
-   Source of Quick Assists for Astral Voice

.. note:: "Initial" Max HP includes:

    -   Agent stats and core
    -   Drive Disk 2PC
    -   Drive Disk main and substats
    -   W-Engine main stats

    If it affects the Agent Base Stats page, then it couns as the "initial" value.

.. note:: Zhao's Core Skill Additional Ability caps at 27000 Max HP. This is the number on the Agent Base Stats page.

    -   9117 HP at Level 60 with Core Skill A/C/E.
    -   2200 HP from Drive Disk Slot 1.
    -   +25% from Original Transformpher W-Engine main stat
    -   +30% from level 15 S-rank Drive Disk slot 4
    -   +30% from level 15 S-rank Drive Disk slot 5
    -   +30% from level 15 S-rank Drive Disk slot 6
    -   +10% from Yunkui Tales 2PC

    That's 25463.25 HP. Since an HP% roll is +3% HP (339.51 HP), the remaining 1536.75 can be achieved with around 4.5 HP% substat rolls.

    -   Can replace Yunkui Tales with 2PC Energy Regen if you make up the 3.33 HP% substat rolls
    -   Can replace slot 6 with Energy Regen if you make up the 10 HP% substat rolls. Note that an ER Slot 6 can roll HP% up to 6 times; the other 4 need to be covered by others

    To use ER 2PC and slot 6 and hit 27000 HP, you need ~19 rolls of HP%; this averages to around 5 rolls per piece (since you can't roll HP% on slot 4 or 5). This is incredibly high so good luck!

Core skill:

-   +1.2% CRIT Rate for every 1000 HP (to herself only); this doesn't seem to cap like her DMG% buff. At 27000, this is +32.4% CRIT Rate.
-   Ether Veil gives +5% Max HP to all squad members
-   Activating Ether Veil gives 700 ATK to all squad members for 50s

Core skill Additional Ability (Attack, Anomaly, Support):

-   Ether Veil gives +40% DMG bonus at 27000 Max HP

Synergies:

-   Ye Shunguang: gets 3 Qingming Sword Force when the veil is opneed

Sets:

-   4PC Astral Voice: +ATK% from Quick Assist
-   4PC : +ATK% from Defensive Assists
-   2PC : + Energy regen

Ye Shunguang (2.5) - Honed Edge (Physical), Attack
==================================================

Summary:

-   High base CRIT Rate
-   +30% CRIT Rate when on battlefield
-   +25% DMG when on battlefield
-   Applies Stun DMG Multipler outside of stun when transformed
-   Get 3 swords when Ether Veil is opened
-   Special Attack can trigger Perfect Dodge (While this does less damage than Dodge Counter (though more Daze), means you don't have to prioritize leveling Dodge Counter)

.. warning:: Ye Shunguang starts at 69.4 CRIT Rate. Aim for 50% on the Agent Base Stats screen.

    -   5% CRIT Rate base (All agents have this)
    -   +14.4% from Core Skill A/C/E 
    -   +30% from Core Skill Passive Effect at F
    -   +20% from 4PC White Water Ballad Drive Disk set effect

    This means you only need 13 CRIT Rate substats to reach 100% CRIT Rate! (Average of around 2 substats per drive disk)

    (Since Core Skill Passive Effect and White Water Ballad are not shown on the Base Stats screen, imagine that 50% is actually 100%. Therefore, don't got over 50%!)

    Since CRIT Rate over 100% is wasted, this makes weapons like Steel Cushion (+24% CRIT Rate) are perhaps a poor choice. It's doable but makes Drive Disk selection trickier since you have fewer relevant substats.

Core Skill Core Passive:

-   +14.4% CRIT Rate
-   +30% CRIT Rate when on battlefield
-   +25% DMG when on battlefield
-   Applies Stun DMG Multipler outside of stun (capped at 110%) for 16s after transforming (using ultimate or 6 swords)

Core skill Additional Ability (Support, Defence)

-   Get 3 swords when Ether Veil is opened by any squadmate (e.g. Lucia, Zhao, Yidhari)

Synergy:

-   Zhao: gets 3 swords whenever they open veil
-   Lucia: gets 3 swords the first time they open veil (since subsequent veils extends duration)

Drive Disks:

-   4PC White Water Ballad: +10% Physical DMG, +20% CRIT Rate, +10% ATK
-   2PC Brand & Blade Song: +16% CRIT DMG

Lucia - Ether, Support
======================

Ether, Support (Rupture)

Summary:

-   Aftershock every 8s
-   +5% Max HP from Ether Veil
-   +20% DMG (skill upgrade or after shock)
-   +30% CRIT DMG
-   +900 Sheer Force (at "initial" 24000 Max HP)

.. note:: Darkbreaker caps out at 24000 initial Max HP.

    HP% from gear:

    -   8477 HP at Level 60
    -   2200 HP from Drive Disk slot 1
    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 4
    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 5
    -   +30% from Drive Disk slot 6
    -   +10% from Yunkui Tales 2PC set effect
 
    That's 10677 + 100% = 21354. Since an HP% roll (+3% HP) is 320.32 HP, the remaining 2646 HP can be made up with 8.26 HP% substat rolls.

    After that, you can focus on CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG to make her aftershocks hit harder. With Dreamlit Hearth (her signature W-Engine which gives +45% HP at P1), consider a CRIT Rate slot 6.

    Since Yunkui Tales 2PC is worth 3.33 HP% substat rolls, you could consider another 2PC set like CRIT Rate; this all depends on the substats that you roll.

    Lucia doesn't need energy regen slot 6 or 2PC. It takes 24s to use all her Dream Points with aftershocks; if you use an energy regen F2P weapon or Dreamlit Hearth, you should get enough energy in that time.

Core Skill Core Passive:

-   +5% Max HP from Ether Veil
-   +20% DMG (skill upgrade or after shock)
-   Perfect Assists when entering the the Dream State (bar fills up)

Core Skill Additional Ability (Rupture, Stun):

-   +30% CRIT DMG from Darkbreaker (using Harmony)

Special Attack:

-   +900 Sheer Force (24000 Max HP)

Playstyle:

-   When not in the dream state, use her EX (+60 Dream Points) followed by Basic Attack (+40 Dream Points) to reach 100 Dream Points and enter Dream state
-   When in dream state, let her do her thing. It doesn't make a lot of sense to sit on her to drain Dream Points faster opportunity cost dictates that you should probably be attacking with another character
-   Use EX Special Attack 

Yuzuha
======

Physical, Support (Anomaly)

Summary:

-   1200 ATK
-   +15% DMG
-   +20% Anomaly Buildup Rate
-   +20% Anomaly DMG
-   +20% Disorder DMG
-   Aftershock every 8s
-   Incrased Anomaly application via Sugarburst Sparkles (ticks every 1s, has +25% buildup)
-   Coordinated attacks from Tanuki
-   Time-based Assist Followup for a lot more damage
-   Choice of show or long EX Special Attack based on 
-   Ultimate gives energy to squad

.. note:: Core Passive caps at 3000 ATK. Since Yuzuha is an anomaly support, the more the better!

.. note:: Core Skill Additional Ability caps at 200 AM. The best you can do F2P is 171.

    AM is not a rollable substat. It only comes from:

    -   Agent stats/core skill. At Level 60 with Core A/C/E, Yuzuha has 124.
    -   Her signature W-Engine: 30/34/39/43/48 AM at P1/2/3/4/5
    -   2PC Phaethon Melody: +8%
    -   Drive Disk slot 6: 30%

    Without her W-Engine, you can only hit 171. With her signture W-Engine at P1, this configuration hits 212 AM.

Core Skill Core Passive:

-   1200 ATK for 40s from EX Special/Ultimate
-   +15% DMG for 40s from EX Special/Ultimate

Core Skill Additional Ability (Anomaly, Spook Shack):

-   +20% Anomaly Buildup Rate (caps at 200 AM)
-   +20% Anomaly DMG (caps at 200 AM)
-   +20% Disorder DMG (caps at 200 AM)

.. note:: As F2P, since you can only hit 171 AM, these are capped at 17.2%
