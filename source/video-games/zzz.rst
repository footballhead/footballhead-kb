ZZZ
===

Yes, I play ZZZ. No, I will not be taking further questions.

`Zenless Optimizer <https://frzyc.github.io/zenless-optimizer/>`_ is still very much in development as is not as easy to use as Genshin Optimizer.

----------
Archetypes
----------

There's three main archetypes as of 2.5:

#.  Attack
#.  Anomaly/Disorder
#.  Rupture

Attack
======

The most straightfoward: mash the button until they die.

Sub archetypes:

#.  Double support (e.g. Soldier-0 Anby with Nicole and Astra)
#.  Stun + Support (e.g. Evelyn with Lighter and Astra)
#.  (Rare) Double stun (e.g. Hugo with Lycaon and Ligher)

Things to look for in teammates:

-   Stat buffs: ATK%, DMG%, PEN%, CRIT Rate, CRIT damage
-   DEF and DMG% shred (e.g. Nicole)
-   Stun multiplier increase, stun duration increase

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: ATK% + CRIT Rate + CRIT DMG
-   Slot 4: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG (whatever you need more of; there's no point in exceeding 100% CRIT Rate)
-   Slot 5: ATK% or DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: ATK%

Anomaly
=======

Focuses on applying anomalies and disorders. Anomaly and disorder damage scale off ATK and Anomaly Proficiency (AP). Anomaly Mastery (AM) contributes to buildup rate (how fast the bars fill).

Sub archetypes:

#.  2 anomaly of different elements, 1 support (e.g. Miyabi (Frost), Vivian (Ether), Yuzuha (Support))
#.  Alice - Polarity disorder means that she doesn't need another anomaly character so her teams are more flexible
#.  Yanagi Mono-Electro - was only viable for a short while after she released

Things to look for in teammates:

-   Stat buffs: ATK%, DMG%, PEN%, AP, AM
-   DEF and DMG% shred (e.g. Nicole)
-   Anomaly Buildup rate increase

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: ATK%, AP, (ATK and PEN to a lesser extent)
-   Slot 4: AP
-   Slot 5: ATK% ot DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: AM

.. note::

    AM is hard to get since it's not a rollable substat. The only sources of Anomaly Mastery are Slot 6, Phaethon's Melody 2PC, S-rank weapons, and agent inherent stats.

Rupture
=======

Rupture is basically Attack except damage tends to scale on HP%. The main advantage Rupture has over Attack is that it ignores enemy DEF. This is useful against enemies with artificially high DEF or anomaly resistance, and enemies with Miasmic Shields

It uses a special stat called Sheer Force; the more the better (within diminishing returns yada yada yada). You can't roll this on a substat but Agents can provide a boost (e.g. Lucia).

Drive Disks:

-   Useful substats: HP% + CRIT Rate + CRIT DMG
-   Slot 4: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG (whatever you need more of; there's no point in exceeding 100% CRIT Rate)
-   Slot 5: HP% or DMG% or PEN%
-   Slot 6: HP%

-----------
Drive Disks
-----------

The maximum number of rolls an artifact can have is 9

-   S rank artifacts start with either 3 or 4 rolls.
-   Since a new stat rools at levels 3/6/9/12/15, that means you get 5 rolls.

Some stats are better than others. One rule of thumb to simplify analysis is to subdivide rolls into:

-   Full stat rolls. These have value of 1. These are stats that you really really really want.
-   Half stat rolls. These have value of 0.5. These still contribute just not as much as full rolls.
-   Useless stats. These have a value of 0. They are worthless and so are omitted entirely.

Rollable substats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%
-   DEF%
-   Flat ATK
-   Flat HP
-   Flat DEF
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG
-   AP
-   PEN

Slot 4 Main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%
-   DEF%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG
-   AP

Slot 5 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%
-   DEF%
-   DMG% (Physical/Electric/Fire/Ice/Ether)
-   PEN%

Slot 6 main stats:

-   ATK%
-   HP%
-   DEF%
-   AM
-   Impact
-   Energy regen

.. note::

    For slot 4/5/6, you can't roll the main stat as a substat. E.g. a CRIT DMG slot 4 can't also roll CRIT DMG.

Differences from Genshin
========================

- 6 drive disks (compared to 5 artifacts)
- You tend to run one 4PC and a different 2PC (compared to a 4PC and an "off piece")
- Energy regen is not a rollable substat
- Stats for ZZZ mechanics: Impact, AP, AM, PEN, PEN% (No Genshin-specific stats: Elemental Mastery)
- Each substat roll has full value (compared to 0.7/0.8/0.9/1.0 random substat rolls)

Attack Theoretical Best
=======================

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   CRIT Rate
-   CRIT DMG

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 3 full rolls: ATK%, CRIT Rate, Crit damage; the 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8.5 (8 full rolls, 1 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, PEN

-   Slot 4: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: CD with ATK%+3, CRIT Rate+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 5: 8.5

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+2, CRIT Rate+2, CRIT DMG+1, flat ATK

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: ATK% with CRIT Rate+3, CRIT DMG+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 50

Anomaly Theoretical Best
========================

Full (1) substat rolls:

-   ATK%
-   Anomaly Proficiency (AP)

.. note::

    Miyabi also benefits from CRIT Rate and crit damage

Half (0.5) substat rolls

-   Flat ATK
-   Flat PEN

.. note::

    While you get 9 rolls (4-line S rank + 5 level up rolls), you can't theoretically get a "9 roll" drive disk since there are only 2 full rolls: ATK%, AP; the 3rd and 4th line has to go to a half stat roll.

Highest possible rolls (assuming the artifact starts at 3.5 rolls):

-   Slot 1/2/3: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half roll)

    -   Example: ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 4: 7 (6 full rolls, 2 half rolls, 1 dead stat)

    -   Example: AP with ATK%+5, flat ATK, PEN, DEF%

        .. note::

            As you can imagine, this is very hard to get! The fact that Miyabi can use CRIT Rate and crit damage really helps her in this department

-   Slot 5: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: PEN% with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Slot 6: 8 (7 full rolls, 2 half rolls)

    -   Example: AM with ATK%+3, AP+2, flat ATK, PEN

-   Total: 47

Rupture
=======

See Attack but replace ATK% with HP%
