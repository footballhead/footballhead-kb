==================
No Man's Sky v1.00
==================

1.00 is the version shipped on the PS4 disk. Most people probably haven't played it since `the developers urged people to download the day-one patch <http://web.archive.org/web/20160807221156/http://www.no-mans-sky.com/2016/08/update-1-03/>`_. Since 1.00 isn't on Steam, a release-day PS4 disk is the only way to play 1.00.

There are a few videos on YouTube exploring this (now rare) version:

- Upgrade tiers are v1, v2, v3, v4 (not Sigma, Tau, etc)
- Can talk to the distress beacon more than once (may require exploring and coming back, also might be only before first lift-off?)
- No save graphic (message is only “restore point saved”)
- Destroying one wave of sentinels escalates and spawns the next. Only way to de-escalate is to flee

Atlas Path Dialogue

Distress Beacon
===============

Initial text:

    I've seen things, a few things, before.

    I left the sun and moon far behind. Galaxies were waiting to be found.

    It begins and ends with you. Infinity awaits.

    - Resist
    - Refuse
    - Begin

Resist:

?

Refuse:

?

Begin:

    It begins.

    I feel as if an unknown power is guiding me. We are combined as one.

Hyperdrive

(Interact with Waypoint // Beacon, get coords for Outpost)

Acquire Hyperdrive Technology

Follow Signal to Contact Lifeform

    I am greeted by a strange warrior lifeform. It has been tracking my starship's movements through the planet's atmosphere, but gives the impression that it has been waiting for far longer.

    It tilts its head, and curls its lips back over its teeth. I am aboutto speak, when it abruptly raises its arm to silence me. It produces what looks (sic) the schematics of an advanced technology. It barks, and indicates that I should take it.

    - Take the blueprint

Take the blueprint

    The warrior barks again in satisfaction. Faint red orbs appear briefly in its eyes.

    Its mission appears complete.
