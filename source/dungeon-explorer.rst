Dungeon Explorer (1990)
=======================

I've done some work reverse-engineering `Dungeon Explorer <https://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/dungeon-explorer/>`_, a DOS EGA CRPG made in Turbo Pascal.

- I've written some documentation here: https://footballhead.github.io/explorer-utils/
- I've also written several tools here: https://github.com/footballhead/explorer-utils
- Most notably, I got the CGA graphics mode working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uXzufDsu8
