Pre-ablo Tips and Strategies
============================

----------
Play Rogue
----------

There's no reason not to play Rogue:

- She can get enough magic (with equipment bonuses) to learn every spell
- She walks faster
- She call kill things from afar
- One of her skills is Identify. Over time, this saves a lot of hassle and money.

The only reason not to play Rogue is that ranged weapons don't proc the life steal on the Undead Crown.

--------------------
Collect a +Magic Set
--------------------

Keep items that have +Magic in town for learning spells. Just drop them on the floor; they'll stay there.

----------------------------
Sell Useless Books for Money
----------------------------

Since you're playing Rogue, unimportant spells like Firebolt and Identify can be sold for 500 gold each. This helps fund important spells like Lightning

------------------------------------------------------
Infinite Health and Mana with Healing and Blood Ritual
------------------------------------------------------

Read every book of Healing and Blood Ritual you come across. Healing uses mana to restore health. Blood Ritual uses health to restore Mana.

You'll reach a breakpoint where you net health and mana by casting Healing and Blood Ritual in succession.

----------------------
Get Level 10 Lightning
----------------------

Lightning costs 0 mana at level 10, does loads of damage, and only costs 10000 gold total if you buy all the books.

--------------------------------------
Save and Load in Town to Restock Shops
--------------------------------------

See a ring you like from Griswold? Save and reload and you can buy 2!

Find a spell you want from Adria? Save and reload to max it out!

------------------
Ditch Cursed Items
------------------

You can't sell them. They're not worth the inventory space.

-----------------------------------------
Pick up scrolls and potions for easy gold
-----------------------------------------

Scrolls of lightning are like 125 gold a piece and only take up one inventory slot.

----------------------------
Pick up Bows and Heavy Armor
----------------------------

They sell for gold more compared to other items.

------------------------------
Kill the Butcher with Firewall
------------------------------

You're likely to find a scroll or staff of Firewall on level 2. This stun-locks the butcher and allows you to kill him.

-------------------------------------
Kill the Skeleton King with Lightning
-------------------------------------

If your Lightning level is high enough, you can cheese the Skeleton King from off-screen by standing in a certain spot and shooting in a specific direction.

---------------------
Get 100% resists asap
---------------------

Without 100% resist you will die to the Thunder Demons and Sucubii very handily. You will stop taking damage, stop flinching, and your armor will not degrade.

------------------------------------------
Avoid Invisibility, Golem, and Etherealize
------------------------------------------

These spells don't work but they cost a lot of money.

----------------------------------
Guardian and Sentinel act the same
----------------------------------

It's not worth learning both Guardian and Sentinel.

------------------------
Don't step into firewall
------------------------

Firewall will do incredible amounts of damange in a short time. Just don't walk into it...
